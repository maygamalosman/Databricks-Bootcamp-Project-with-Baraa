Databricks Bootcamp Project with Baraa

This project was completed as part of the Databricks Bootcamp created by Baraa Khatib Salkini. It follows the step-by-step roadmap and the Notion workspace provided during the live sessions.

The goal of this project was to build a complete analytics workflow on Databricks - starting from raw data and ending with SQL-driven insights and interactive dashboards.

🚀 What I Learned & Applied

Through this project, I was able to:

Use Databricks SQL Editor to explore and analyze data

Apply my existing SQL knowledge in a modern cloud data platform

Work with fact, customer, and product tables in a real analytics schema

Create interactive visualizations directly from SQL queries

Build dashboards with local and global filters for business users

Follow a workflow similar to what real analytics teams use in companies

Databricks made it easy to move from data → query → visualization → dashboard in one environment.

🛠️ Project Data Model

The project is based on three main tables:

dim_products

dim_customers

fact_sales

These tables were used to build analytical queries and business insights.

📈 What I Achieved:

1️⃣ SQL Analysis & Visualizations

I built multiple SQL queries in Databricks SQL Editor and converted them into visualizations.

2️⃣ Interactive Dashboards

I created dashboards that combine multiple charts and added global and local filters to allow users to explore the data.

3️⃣ Chat with Data using AI Genie

I used Databricks Genie (AI) to ask questions in natural language and generate SQL queries to answer business questions.

🙏 Acknowledgment

Special thanks to Baraa for delivering more than 8 hours of live, hands-on sessions. His sketches, explanations, and practical teaching style made complex data and SQL concepts easy to understand and apply from day one.

I'm also grateful to Databricks for providing a free learning environment that allows data professionals to build real analytics projects.

🎯 Next Step

I am passionate about Data Analytics and excited to apply these skills in real business projects where data drives decisions.
